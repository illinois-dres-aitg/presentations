                        Goals</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      This presentation is an invitation to learning about measuring web accessibility for people with disabilities and understanding the limitations of automated testing for accessibility.

      Most accessibility requirements cannot be tested automatically.

      Designers and developers need to understand accessibility requirements and build accessibility in to a website or web application during the design and development stage of a project.

      Just like adding curbcuts to sidewalks is much less expensive and more elegant when the sidewalks are initially built.

      The presentation concludes with the results of scanning over 1,700 websites from 151 educational institutions organized by basketball conferences.

      I will first give some background in why web accessibility is important.

      Second I will discuss the primary issues in measuring web accessibility.

      Third will look at summary data for groups of rules and for selected individual rules.

      Fourth, what everyone wants to know, where does my university rank in the accessibility scans I made in September of 2020.

      I will conclude with information on where you can get the open source tools used in this project.

      The slides for this presentation all use HTML markup and are publicly available on the web and a transcript of my voice is available on each slide, look for the Audio Transcript button.

      The "current slide URL" link on this page can be used to go to the actual HTML slides.

                        Slide 2:
                        Why Accessibility?</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      Accessibility for people with disabilities is part of building an inclusive culture on your campus.
      Disability has traditionally not been included within diversity and inclusion initiatives in higher education.
      One issue is just counting students with disabilities, since students do not have to disclose their disability as part of their college application and the university is required not to ask.
      But disability is a part of the lives of approximately 1 out of every 10 students on campus.
      As information technology has become more apart of the educational experience, disability rights have been extended to include more than physical access buildings, but also to the virtual world of information technologies, just like curbcuts and ramps were eventually required to make sidewalks and buildings on campus accessible to students in wheelchairs back in the 1970s.
      Disability inclusion approaches based on Universal Design give all students more ways to learn course content, resulting in students taking less time to learn a topic and fewer questions to the instructor.
      For example in one study of an online math course using pre-recorded videos, half the class received the videos with captioning and half the class did not have captions.  The group with captions on the average spent 40% less time, approximately 45 hours saved, watching the videos with no significant difference in the grade distributions at the end of the course.
      Which videos would your rather watch?
      When instructional materials and online resources are accessible, students with disabilities do not need to request accommodations or spend time trying to explain to their instructor why their needs are different from other students.
      When students don't have to ask for accommodations, it makes them feel more included in the campus culture and gives them more time to focus on learning, rather than educating instructors on why they need something different and the delays in getting information in the format they need.

                        Slide 3:
                        Disabilities Registered with DRES at Illinois</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
        The chart in this slide shows the distribution of disabilities that are registered with disability services at Illinois during the 2019-2020 academic year.

        If you cannot see the chart or have difficulty reading charts there is an option to view a table of the data after the chart on the web page.

        I am pointing to the number of students in each category in the chart using the mouse:

        The chart shows:
        838 students with psychological diagnosis which effect learning in some way, example accommodations include taking tests in a safe environment or flexible schedules due to medication schedules or episodic situations.

        641 students with ADHD that may need coaching for prioritizing their work or distraction free testing accommodations.

        362 students with systemic or medical conditions that effect their daily living, for example a chronic disease like arthritis which may restrict mobility and reduced stamina.

        167 students with physical mobility impairments due to amputations or paralysis.

        161 students with learning disabilities that require the student to use different strategies to learn some types of materials, often requiring materials in electronic format for reading using speech.

        49 students who are Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing, these students rely on interpreters and text captioning for learning.

        47 students who are Blind or visually impaired who need print material in electronic formats or Braille with descriptions of images and graphics.

        16 students with acquired brain injury, including soldiers returning from overseas deployments, which often results in both learning disabilities and physiological issues which is helped by having multi-modal and flexible learning environments.

        2 students with impaired speech making it difficult for them to communicate to their instructors or fellow students.  In these cases disability staff can help develop communication strategies help the student to express their ideas in instructional settings and be a part of social groups with peers.

        While the traditional stereotype of disability is someone with vision, hearing or physical impairment, from the chart you can see that the vast majority of students registered have ADHD, learning disabilities or psychological conditions that effect their learning.

        The largest groups are often referred to as hidden disabilities, and so it is often difficult for people to understand their needs for materials in certain formats to support learning.

        It should be noted that typically only about a third of students with disabilities in higher education actually register for disability related accommodations.

        In a survey of all students at Illinois a few years ago, students who self identify as having a disability, only a third said they used disability services.

        Another third reported they did not need accommodations or could negotiate them on their own.

        The remaining third said they did not even know there were disability services available on campus.

        So you can see there are a lot of students in higher education and many students who can benefit from universal design in learning.

                        Slide 4:
                        Distribution of Disability by Age</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
The chart in this side shows that disability becomes a pretty inclusive club as people age in the United States.

If you cannot see the chart or have difficulty reading charts there is an option to view a table of the data after the chart on the web page.

The chart shows the percentage of the population that has any disability, a severe disability and a disability that needs assistance for activities of daily living for nine different age ranges.

I am going to point to the rate of severe disability in the charts using the mouse:

3.6% for people under 15 years old.

5% for people 15 to 24 years old.

7.5% for people 25 to 44 years old.

12.6% for people 45 to 54 years old.

20.8% for people 55 to 64 years old.

26.1% for people 65 to 69 years old.

27.6% for people 70 to 74 years old.

37.8% for people 75 to 79 years old.

56.2% for people over 80.

By age 80, about half of people with severe disability need some type of daily assistance.

The ability to use the web will continue to be important as we age, so designing web pages to be accessible not only helps people with disabilities now, including our family and friends, but most likely we will also be helping ourselves as we age.

<a id="slide5" target="slides" href="slide5.html">
                        Slide 5:
                        Distribution of Types of Disabilities by Age Range</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      One of the questions many people new to accessibility ask is how many people have disabilities?

      How many people will be impacted if I make a website more accessible?

      While one slide cannot provide a detailed answer to these questions, the chart on this slide does provide some insights to the prevalence of four broad types of disability as we age: vision, hearing, mobility and cognitive.

      If you cannot see the chart or have difficulty reading charts there is an option to view a data table just after the chart on the web page.

      From the perspective of web design, it is easy for people to understand how someone with a visual impairment who has trouble seeing the computer screen or cannot see the screen at all would have trouble using a web page.

      For example, one of the best-known accessibility requirements is providing a text description or Alternative Text for each image in a web page, so that someone using a screen reader can understand the purpose of the image.

      I am going to point to bars in the chart with the mouse to highlight how the rate of visual impairments increases with age:

      0.4% for people less than 5 years old.

      0.9% for people from 5 to 17 years old.

      2% for people from 18 to 64 years old.

      6.6% of people over 65 years age.

      Multiply these percentages by 7 billion people and you can see that millions of people with visual impairments are affected by the design decisions of web developers and web development teams.

      People with hearing impairments have similar demographics as people with visual impairments.  I am going to point to bars in the chart with the mouse to highlight how the rate of hearing impairments increases with age:

      0.5% for people less than 5 years old.

      0.6% for people from 5 to 17 years old.

      2% for people from 18 to 64 years old.

      14.6% of people over 65 years of age.

      Comparing the hearing impairments to visual Impairments shows similar instances, until age 65.

      At 65 there are more than twice as many people with hearing impairments as visual impairments.

      The main design feature for people with hearing impairments is the availability of captions for videos.

      Captioning videos is a real winner for making the web more useful to everyone, since captions also benefit people who&rsquo;s native language is different from the speakers on the video.

      For example, here at the University of Illinois we have many students from foreign countries including India and China.

      The use of video lectures has greatly increased in the past couple of years and in some courses the lectures are only available as a video, similar to the course you are taking now.

      While these students learn English before they come to the United States, for many of them the ability to read English is much better than their ability to listen to English, since there are often few opportunities to listen to native English speakers in other countries.

      In this case the captions will help them understand the lecture content much more easily.

      The captions can also help many students with learning disabilities that have trouble processing speech.

      The redundancy of the captions with the speech helps students to learn much more efficiently.

      Caption text can also be used by search engines to help people find specific topics of interest within a video.

      It is much easier to search for keywords in a video with closed captions, than videoes without closed captions.

      People with mobility impairments are not as common until people are over 18 years of age when about 5% of the population experiences a mobility impairment of some type and then increase to 22% for people over 65 years old.   Not all mobility impairments affect the ability to use computing and mobile technologies, but many do affect the ability of people to type on a keyboard, move and activate the button on a mouse, or point and tap their finger on a touch screen device.  In these cases, there is a need to make sure that web and mobile apps can be operated with assistive technologies like voice input or other devices that make it appear the person is typing from a keyboard or pointing on a touch screen.

      One of the most difficult to understand areas of making web pages accessible is for people with learning disabilities and cognitive impairments.

      I am going to point with the mouse to bars in the chart to show the prevalence of identified cognitive impairments:

      4.2% for people from 5 to 17 years old.

      4.5% for people from 18 to 64 years old.

      22.5% of people over 65 years of age.

      Current accessibility standards related specifically to cognitive impairments and learning disability are relatively few, but there is a wealth of information on how Universal Design in Learning techniques give students more options in learning course materials and demonstrating their knowledge of what they have learned.

                        Measuring Accessibility</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      In measuring web accessibility it is important to understand two main concepts.
      The first is the standard for which accessibility will be measured against, the W3C web content accessibility guidelines.

      The second is the extent automated rules can be used to measure accessibility.

      Most WCAG accessibility requirements cannot be measured automatically.

      Care must be taken to not over interpret the meaning of automated test results, especially if the results to indicate few accessibility issues.

                        Slide 7:
                        W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines or WCAG is the internationally recognized standard for the accessibility of web content, including the United States Federal Section 508 web accessibility requirements.

      Some important features to know about WCAG is that while it was inspired by the need to make HTML based documents and applications accessible, it was designed to be technology agnostic.

       WCAG can and is applied to a wider range of technologies, for example PDF documents and web application technologies like Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight.

       WCAG is even being adapted to identify the features to make mobile applications accessible.

      The WCAG requirements identify the accessibility needs of people with disabilities to access online resources, with supporting references to techniques to help people learn how the needs can be met with a specific technology, like HTML or Adobe PDF.
      It is important to note the techniques are just advisory, they are incomplete and often missing common best practices.

      People looking for a design resource in the WCAG techniques reference will mostly be disappointed and frustrated, since the techniques are typically based on minimum requirements in code needed for what the working group considers sufficient implementation of a Success Criteria requirement.

                        Slide 8:
                        Organization of WCAG</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      We don&rsquo;t have time to take a deep dive into WCAG, but I would like to give you a little more information into the organization of WCAG.

      At the top level are the 4 principles, Perceiving, Operable, Understanding and Robust.

      The first letters spell out the word POUR, so you often hear people talk about the POUR principles of accessibility.

      The principles are divided into 13 sub-categories called Guidelines which provide more specific labels for groups of success criteria.

      The Guidelines for Perceivable include:
        Text Alternatives.
        Time-based Media.
        Adaptable.
        Distinguishable.

      The Guidelines for Operable:
        Keyboard Accessible.
        Enough Time.
        Seizures.
        Navigable.
        and new WCAG 2.1 Input Modalities.

      The Guidelines for Readable:
        Readable.
        Predictable.
        and Input Assistance.

      There is only one Guideline for Robust:
        Compatible.

      I guess they wanted the &ldquo;R&rdquo; of Robust, instead of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; of Compatible to make the acronym &ldquo;POUR&rdquo;. Who wants to say &ldquo;POUC&rdquo;?

      The Success Criteria are the real requirements of WCAG.
      Each success criteria can have one of three priorities:
      Single A.
      Double A.
      Triple A.
      The Single A requirements have the highest priority for implementation and conformance.
      The Double AA requirements have the next highest priority for implementation and conformance.
      The Triple-A requirements have the lowest priority for implementation and conformance.

      The priority for a requirement is based on the consensus of the WCAG working group and take into account the importance and difficulty in implementation.

      The legal conformance standards for accessibility are based on the Single A and Double AA requirements.

      The priority is important when retrofitting accessibility into existing designs, since changes are difficult and expensive to make.

      Analogy is adding curb cuts to an already existing sidewalk, it requires using jack hammers and chisels to remove the existing concrete, before pouring the cement for the curbcut.

      On new sidewalks the curb cuts require little if any additional work and the same is true when designing a new web resource.

      When companies and organizations consider accessibility during the design phase of product development there is typically no or little cost in adding accessibility features, and accessibility testing can more easily integrated into the testing plan for the product or service.

      The priorities therefore guide companies and organizations who are new to accessibility requirements in identifying where to start their accessibility efforts.

                        Automated Rules</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      The automated rules used in this study could have one of five results.

      The first is passed, which means the accessibility requirement has been met.
      For example an IMG element has an ALT attribute.

      The second is a violation, which means a required accessibility feature is missing.
      For example a form control is missing a label.

      The third is a warning, which means a recommended accessibility feature is missing.
      For example an ALT text description should be less than 100 characters for the English language.

      The fourth is a manual check.  This means there is markup in the web page that indicates this rule might apply and it is up to the author to determine if an accessibility requirement applies and if it does, has the requirement been met.

      The fifth result is not applicable.  This means the markup was not found in the web page that would apply to this rule.

      For a typical website 35-40% of the rule results are passed, violations or warnings.  The rest require manual inspection and testing.

</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      The purpose of this poster session is to help people understand the strengths and weaknesses of automated testing and that many WCAG requirements require manual checking, which means knowledge on the part of the designers and developers.

      The hope of this presentation is to encourage universities to start thinking about accessibility during the design stage of a website or application, where adding accessibility features is much easier and accessibility quality assurance can be included in the quality assurance process.

      The data was collected in September of 2020.

      Over 1,700 websites from 151 universities were analyzed for this presentation.

      The website came from university home pages, the home pages of major colleges, disability services, admissions and financial aid.

      A total of 129,287 web pages were analyzed.

</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      Only public facing websites were evaluated, so password protected website could not be included.

      Only a small sample of websites from a university were analyzed due to the time it takes to spider web pages.

      Web applications used for managing courses and providing interactive experiences were not included, and typically have significant accessibility issues.

      Web applications need authentication and more complex testing strategies than simple spidering of web pages and analyzing mostly static content.

      Note that web applications like course management systems and other collaboration tools used in higher education are a challenge to meet WCAG accessibility requirements due to the level of interaction and user interface complexity.

</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      This chart in this slide shows the results related to groups of rules organized by rule categories for all 129,287 pages analyzed.

      The set of rules used in this evaluation has at least one rule for each WCAG 2.0 level A and double A requirements.

      If you cannot see the chart or have difficulty reading charts there is an option to view a table of the data after the chart on the web page.

      The green portion of the bars indicate the percentage of rules that passed in the rule category.

      The red portion of the bars indicate the percentage of rules that failed in the rule category.

      The yellow portion of the bars indicate the percentage of manual checks in the rule category.

      You can see from the chart more than half of the rule results require manual checking and for the rules related to site navigation, timing and audio/video can only be checked through human inspection and understanding of the requirements.

      While the green portion dominates the red portion of the bars, it can be seen that there are significant failures for rules related to landmarks, headings, links and data tables.

      With data tables having the highest percentage of known accessibility issues.

      The widgets/scripts category is also misleading, since scripting accessibility issues require knowledge of Accessible Rich Internet Application or ARIA technologies to make sure the behaviors and sections of a website are properly defined.

      The passing and failing rules in the widget/script category are only looking for syntax errors, not if the ARIA was applied properly to describe the features and behaviors of the page.

      The weight of the manual checking rules related to scripting and keyboard support are critical for accessibility requirements to be met.

                        Slide 13:
                        Selected Rule Results for 2020</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      This chart shows selected rule results with the associated passed, failed and manual check rules using the same green, red and yellow for the bars as in the previous chart.

      If you cannot see the chart or have difficulty reading charts there is an option to view a table of the data after the chart on the web page.

      The first rule "All Content in Landmarks" is used to measure how much of rendered content is associated with a named region on the screen.  The high level of conformance for this rule may be deceptive since common HTML sectioning elements like header, footer, nav and aside elements automatically create landmark regions, usually in a way that supports accessibility, but in some cases their may be too many landmark regions or content in a landmark region that is not appropriate.

      The second rule is the presence of a Main Landmark region, which requires authors to specifically define a main landmark region using a role attribute or the main element.
      This is a better indicator of authors using landmark regions appropriately in their design, because adding a main landmark region is usually not done by accident.  The chart shows almost 80% of web pages are using a main landmark region.

      The third rules identifies if a main landmark region beging with an H1 heading.  This rule passes over 80% of the web pages measured.  Having an H1 heading element identify the start of the main content makes it easy for screen reader users to locate and navigate the main content of the page.

      The fourth rule identifies properly nested headings, which passes for over 80% of the web pages and is an indicator the author is using HTML heading markup correctly, making it easier for screen reader users to navigate the sections of a web page.

      The fifth rule is looking at Color Contrast Ratio of text in a web page, and is passing at less than 80% for web pages.  Color contrast ratio is critical for people with visual impairments and this result indicates there is a significant portion of web page content that will not be accessible to many people.  Notice this rule has a manual checking component which is a larger portion of the result than failures of the rule.  The Manual check is required when text is placed on top of a background image.  The background not being a solid color is beyond the capability of the current ruleset to compute, due to the difficulty in getting access to the image colors and alignment with the text.

      The sixth rule ois checking for the use of ALT attribute on an IMG element and is probably the most well known rule for accessibility, since it is pretty easy for most people to understand that for someone who cannot see the image they will need some type of description.  Even though this rule is passing more than 90% of the time, there are a significant number of images that do not have a description.

      The seventh rule is the Unique link text rule and it is passing at less than 60% of the time.   The most common problem this rule identifies is when authors have links like "more" or "click here" which do not describe where the link will take the user.

      The eighth and ninth rules related to data tables are a huge problem as shown by the low compliance of providing an accessible name and headers to provide context to the content of the data cells.

      The tenth rule for labeling form controls has steadily improved over the past 10 years to almost 90% compliance in this evaluation.  Ten years ago when I started these evaluations less that 50% of form controls had labels.  But this is such an important and easy requirement to implement it hard to understand why compliance is not higher.

      The eleventh rule identifying the use of grouping labels for radio buttons using fieldset and legend elements is still an area of poor implementation, with just over 50% compliance.  There is definitely a need for form designers to learn more about creating accessible forms with accessible error feedback.

      The twelfth rule related to the Skip to main link provides a means for keyboard only users to move directly to the main content of the page and is implemented in about 70% of the pages evaluated.  The feature is considered a basic accessibility feature and was one of the first rules created for making web pages accessible.

      The last four rules in the chart related to videos having captions, audio must have an alternative, the ability of users to have time to respond to web pages with time outs and website navigation features and all the rules require manual checks.

      These four rules need to be addressed during the design of the website, because just like curbcuts in sidewalks they are expensive to retrofit into production websites.

                        2020 Sweet 16 Universities</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      The chart and table in this slide shows the accessibility ranking for the top 24 universities based on the highest percentage of rules passed for all the web pages evaluated for that university.

      As you have learned earlier in this presentation there are a lot of caveats with these rankings do to the limited number of pages tested, the exclusion of web applications and the inherit nature of many accessibility requirements needing manual checks.

      It is kind of a fun way to compare universities and engage in the natural rivalries between higher educational institutions to motivate people to dive deeper into the accessibility of their campus websites.

      The winner this year is the University of Buffalo.

      Congratulations!

      There is a link to look at all the results, so if you don't see your school in this chart you can look at the data for all 151 universities.

</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      The chart and table in this slide shows the accessibility ranking for the athletic conferences used in this evaluation based on the highest percentage of rules passed for all the web pages associated with that conference.

      The limitations of this evaluation were discussed in the previous slide.

      The top conference this year was the Midamerican conference, followed by non-conference schools and the Big Ten.

                        Conclusions</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      The results of this research show there is still much work to do to improve the accessibility and usability of web resources to people with disabilities in higher education.

      It is clear accessibility has a significant human resources component.

      More people at our institutions need to know about accessibility.

      People don't need to know everything about accessibility, but they need to know what is important for their job or role.

      Universities need to implement proactive plans to support the accessibility and usability of online administrative and instructional materials.

      An important part of those plans need to include procurement processes that encourage vendors to provide accessible web applications.

      To move web accessibility into the main stream of the campus culture authoring tools used to create online content need to support authors in learning about and including accessibility features in the online resources they create.

      Ask vendors how their products not only meet accessibility requirements, but also how they help your students, faculty and staff learn about and create content that support the principles of Universal Design in Learning.

      The links on this slide are to tools that use the same ruleset and evaluation engine used in this evaluation.

      AInspector for Firefox is a extension for Firefox than analyzes the currently opened window in Firefox and generates a report shown in the left hand sidebar.

      The Functional Accessibility Evaluator or FAE is a server based tool to spider a website and provide both page and website level reports.

      The accessibility bookmarklets can be used on all modern browsers to visually highlight hidden accessibility information on web pages, which is very useful for manual inspection of web accessibility requirements.

      These are open source tools, so they are free for you to use and share.

      Please contact me if you have any questions.
