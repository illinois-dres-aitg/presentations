                        Goals</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      This presentation is an invitation to learning about measuring web accessibility for people with disabilities and understanding the limitations of automated testing for accessibility.
      The presentation concludes with the results of scanning over 1,700 websites from over 200 educational institutions organized by basketball conferences.
      I will first give some background in why web accessibility is important.
      Second I will discuss the primary issues in measuring web accessibility.
      Third will look at summary data for groups of rules and for selected individual rules.
      Fourth, what everyone will want to know, is where does my university rank in the accessibility scans I made in September of 2020.
      I will conclude with information on where you can get the open source tools used in this project.

                        Why Accessibility?</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      Accessibility for people with disabilities is part of building an inclusive culture on your campus.
      Disability has traditionally not been included within diversity and inclusion initiatives in higher education.
      One issue is just counting students with disabilities, since students do not have to divulge their disability as part of their college application and the university is required not to ask.
      But disability is a part of the lives of approximately 1 out of every 10 students on campus.
      As information technology has become more apart of the educational experience, disability rights have been extended to include access to information technologies, just like curbcuts and ramps were eventually required to make sidewalks and buildings on campus accessible to students in wheelchairs.
      Disability inclusion approaches based on Universal Design give all students more ways to learn course content, resulting in students taking less time to learn a topic and fewer questions to the instructor.
      For example in one study of online course using pre-recorded videos, half the class received the videos with captioning and half the class did not have captions.  The group with captions on the average spent 40% less time watching the videos with no significant difference in the grade distributions at the end of the course.
      Which videos would your rather watch?
      When instructional materials and online resources are accessible, students with disabilities do not need to request accommodations or spend time trying to explain to their instructor why their needs are different from other students.
      When students don't have to ask for accommodations, it makes them feel more included in the campus culture and gives them more time to focus on learning, rather than educating instructors on why they need something different and the delays in getting information in the format they need.

                        Disabilities Registered with DRES at Illinois</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
        The chart in this slide shows the distribution of disabilities that are registered with disability services at Illinois.
        The chart shows:
        AA students who are blind or visually impaired.
        BB students who are deaf or hard of hearing.
        CC students who have physical or mobility impairments.
        DD students who have learning disabilities.
        EE students with
        While the traditional stereotype of disability is someone with vision, hearing or physical impairement, from the chart you can see that the vast majority of students registered have learning disabilities or psychological conditions that effect their learning.
        The later two groups are often referred to as hidden disabilities, and so it is often difficult for people to understand their needs for materials in certain formats to support their learning.
        It should be noted that typically only about a third of students with disabilities in higher education actually register for disability related accommodations.
        In a survey of all students at Illinois a few years ago, students who self identify as having a disability only a third said they used disability services.
        Another third said they did not need accommodations or could negotiate them on their own.
        The remaining third said they did not even know there were disability services available on campus.
        So you can see there are a lot of students in higher education and many students will benefit from accessible design.

                        Slide 4:
                        Distribution of Disability by Age</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
The chart in this side shows that disability becomes a pretty inclusive club as people age in the United States.

If you cannot see the chart or have difficulty reading charts there is an option to view a table of the data after the chart on the web page.

The chart shows the percentage of the population that has any disability, a severe disability and a disability that needs assistance for activities of daily living for nine different age ranges.  I am going to point to the rate of severe disability in the charts using the mouse:

3.6% for people under 15 years old.

5% for people 15 to 24 years old.

7.5% for people 25 to 44 years old.

12.6% for people 45 to 54 years old.

20.8% for people 55 to 64 years old.

26.1% for people 65 to 69 years old.

27.6% for people 70 to 74 years old.

37.8% for people 75 to 79 years old.

56.2% for people over 80.

By age 80, about half of people with severe disability need some type of daily assistance.

The ability to use the web will continue to be important as we age, so designing web pages to be accessible not only helps people with disabilities now, including our family and friends, but most likely we will be also helping ourselves as we age.

<a id="slide5" target="slides" href="slide5.html">
                        Slide 5:
                        Distribution of Types of Disabilities by Age Range</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
One of the questions many people new to accessibility ask is how many people have disabilities?

How many people will be impacted if I make a website more accessible?

 While one slide cannot provide a detailed answer to these questions, the chart on this slide does provide some insights to the prevalence of four broad types of disability as we age: vision, hearing, mobility and cognitive.

If you cannot see the chart or have difficulty reading charts there is an option to view a data table just after the chart on the web page.

From the perspective of web design, it is easy for people to understand how someone with a visual impairment who has trouble seeing the computer screen or cannot see the screen at all would have trouble using a web page.

For example, one of the best-known accessibility requirements is providing a text description or Alternative Text for each image in a web page, so that someone using a screen reader can understand the purpose of the image.

I am going to point to bars in the chart with the mouse to highlight how the rate of visual impairments increases with age:

0.4% for people less than 5 years old.

0.9% for people from 5 to 17 years old.

2% for people from 18 to 64 years old.

6.6% of people over 65 years age.

Multiply these percentages by 7 billion people and you can see that millions of people with visual impairments are affected by the design decisions of web developers and web development teams.

People with hearing impairments have similar demographics as people with visual impairments.  I am going to point to bars in the chart with the mouse to highlight how the rate of hearing impairments increases with age:

0.5% for people less than 5 years old.

0.6% for people from 5 to 17 years old.

2% for people from 18 to 64 years old.

14.6% of people over 65 years of age.

Comparing the hearing impairments to visual Impairments shows similar instances, until age 65.

At 65 there are more than twice as many people with hearing impairments as visual impairments.

The main design feature for people with hearing impairments is the availability of captions for videos.

Captioning videos is a real winner for making the web more useful to everyone, since captions also benefit people who&rsquo;s native language is different from the speakers on the video.  For example, here at the University of Illinois we have many students from foreign countries including India and China.  The use of video lectures has greatly increased in the past couple of years and in some courses the lectures are only available as a video, similar to the course you are taking now.  While these students learn English before they come to the United States, for many of them the ability to read English is much better than their ability to listen to English, since there are often few opportunities to listen to native English speakers in other countries.  In this case the captions will help them understand the lecture content much more easily.   The captions can also help many students with learning disabilities that have trouble processing speech.  The redundancy of the captions with the speech helps students to learn much more efficiently.   Caption text can also be used by search engines to help people find specific topics of interest within a video.  It is much easier to search for keywords in a video with closed captions, than videoes without closed captions.

People with mobility impairments are not as common until people are over 18 years of age when about 5% of the population experiences a mobility impairment of some type and then increase to 22% for people over 65 years old.   Not all mobility impairments affect the ability to use computing and mobile technologies, but many do affect the ability of people to type on a keyboard, move and activate the button on a mouse, or point and tap their finger on a touch screen device.  In these cases, there is a need to make sure that web and mobile apps can be operated with assistive technologies like voice input or other devices that make it appear the person is typing from a keyboard or pointing on a touch screen.

One of the most difficult to understand areas of making web pages accessible is for people with learning disabilities and cognitive impairments.

I am going to point with the mouse to bars in the chart to show the prevalence of identified cognitive impairments:

4.2% for people from 5 to 17 years old.

4.5% for people from 18 to 64 years old.

22.5% of people over 65 years of age.

Current accessibility standards related specifically to cognitive impairments are relatively few, but standards continue to be developed to help designers and developers better understand the needs of people with cognitive impairments.

                        Slide 6:
                        Measuring Accessibility</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      In measuring web accessibility it is important to understand two main concepts.
      The first is the standard for which accessibility will be measured against, the W3C web content accessibility guidelines.
      The second is the extent automated rules can be used to measure accessibility.
      Most WCAG accessibility requirements cannot be measured automatically, so care must be taken to not over interpret the meaning of automated test results, especially if the results to indicate few accessibility issues.

                        Slide 7:
                        W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines or WCAG is the internationally recognized standard for the accessibility of web content, including the United States Federal Section 508 web accessibility requirements.
      Some important features to know about WCAG is that while it was inspired by the need to make HTML based documents and applications accessible, it was designed to be technology agnostic so it could be applied to a wider range of technologies, for example PDF documents and web application technologies like Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight.
      The requirements identify the accessibility needs of people with disabilities to access online resources, with supporting references to techniques to help people learn how the needs can be met with a specific technology, like HTML or Adobe PDF.
      It is important to note the techniques are just advisory, they are incomplete and often missing common best practices.
      People looking for a design resource in the technique reference will mostly be disappointed and frustrated, since the techniques are typically based on minimum requirements in code needed for what the working group considers sufficient implementation of a Success Criteria requirement.

<a id="slide8" target="slides" href="slide8.html">
                        Slide 8:
                        Organization of WCAG</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      We don&rsquo;t have time to take a deep dive into WCAG, but I would like to give you a little more information into the organization of WCAG.
      At the top level are the 4 principles, Perceiving, Operable, Understanding and Robust. With Robust requirements requiring the use of standards and built-in operating system features to support interoperability and compatibility with assistive technologies.
      The principles are divided into 13 sub-categories called Guidelines which provide more specific labels for groups of success criteria.
      The Guidelines for Perceivable include:
        Text Alternatives.
        Time-based Media.
        Adaptable.
        Distinguishable.

      The Guidelines for Operable:
        Keyboard Accessible.
        Enough Time.
        Seizures.
        Navigable.
        and new WCAG 2.1 Input Modalities.

      The Guidelines for Readable:
        Readable.
        Predictable.
        and Input Assistance.

      There is only one Guideline for Robust:
        Compatible.

      I guess they wanted the &ldquo;R&rdquo; of Robust, instead of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; of Compatible to make the acronym &ldquo;POUR&rdquo;. Who wants to say &ldquo;POUC&rdquo;?

      The Success Criteria are the real requirements of WCAG.
      Each success criteria can have one of three priorities: Single A, Double A or Triple A
      The Single A requirements have the highest priority for implementation and conformance
      The Double AA requirements have the next highest priority implementation and conformance
      The Triple-A requirements have the lowest priority for implementation and conformance

      The priority for a requirement is based on the consensus of the WCAG working group.

      The legal conformance standards for accessibility are based on the Single A and Double AA requirements.

      The priority is important when retrofitting accessibility into existing designs, since changes are difficult and expensive to make.
      Analogy is adding curb cuts to an already existing sidewalk, it requires using jack hammers and chisels to remove the existing concrete, before pouring the cement for the curb cut.
      On new sidewalks the curb cuts require little if any additional work and the same is true when designing a new web resource.
      When companies and organizations consider accessibility during the design phase of product development there is typically no or little cost in adding accessibility features, and accessibility testing can more easily integrated into the testing plan for the product or service.
      The priorities therefore guide companies and organizations who are new to accessibility requirements in identifying where to start their accessibility efforts.
