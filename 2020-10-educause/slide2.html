      Accessibility for people with disabilities is part of building an inclusive culture on your campus.
      Disability has traditionally not been included within diversity and inclusion initiatives in higher education.
      One issue is just counting students with disabilities, since students do not have to divulge their disability as part of their college application and the university is required not to ask.
      But disability is a part of the lives of approximately 1 out of every 10 students on campus.
      As information technology has become more apart of the educational experience, disability rights have been extended to include access to information technologies, just like curbcuts and ramps were eventually required to make sidewalks and buildings on campus accessible to students in wheelchairs.
      Disability inclusion approaches based on Universal Design give all students more ways to learn course content, resulting in students taking less time to learn a topic and fewer questions to the instructor.
      For example in one study of online course using pre-recorded videos, half the class received the videos with captioning and half the class did not have captions.  The group with captions on the average spent 40% less time watching the videos with no significant difference in the grade distributions at the end of the course.
      Which videos would your rather watch?
      When instructional materials and online resources are accessible, students with disabilities do not need to request accommodations or spend time trying to explain to their instructor why their needs are different from other students.
      When students don't have to ask for accommodations, it makes them feel more included in the campus culture and gives them more time to focus on learning, rather than educating instructors on why they need something different and the delays in getting information in the format they need.
