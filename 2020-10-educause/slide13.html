      This chart shows selected rule results with the associated passed, failed and manual check rules using the same green, red and yellow for the bars as in the previous chart.

      If you cannot see the chart or have difficulty reading charts there is an option to view a table of the data after the chart on the web page.

      The first rule "All Content in Landmarks" is used to measure how much of rendered content is associated with a named region on the screen.  The high level of conformance for this rule may be deceptive since common HTML sectioning elements like header, footer, nav and aside elements automatically create landmark regions, usually in a way that supports accessibility, but in some cases their may be too many landmark regions or content in a landmark region that is not appropriate.

      The second rule is the presence of a Main Landmark region, which requires authors to specifically define a main landmark region using a role attribute or the main element.
      This is a better indicator of authors using landmark regions appropriately in their design, because adding a main landmark region is usually not done by accident.  The chart shows almost 80% of web pages are using a main landmark region.

      The third rules identifies if a main landmark region beging with an H1 heading.  This rule passes over 80% of the web pages measured.  Having an H1 heading element identify the start of the main content makes it easy for screen reader users to locate and navigate the main content of the page.

      The fourth rule identifies properly nested headings, which passes for over 80% of the web pages and is an indicator the author is using HTML heading markup correctly, making it easier for screen reader users to navigate the sections of a web page.

      The fifth rule is looking at Color Contrast Ratio of text in a web page, and is passing at less than 80% for web pages.  Color contrast ratio is critical for people with visual impairments and this result indicates there is a significant portion of web page content that will not be accessible to many people.  Notice this rule has a manual checking component which is a larger portion of the result than failures of the rule.  The Manual check is required when text is placed on top of a background image.  The background not being a solid color is beyond the capability of the current ruleset to compute, due to the difficulty in getting access to the image colors and alignment with the text xontet.

      The use of ALT attribute on an IMG element is the poster child accessibility rule for accessibility and probably the most well known rule for accessibility, since it is pretty esay for most people to understand that for someone who cannot see the image they will need some type of description.  Even though this rule is passing more than 90% of the time, there are a significant number of images that do not have a description.

      The Unique link text rule is passing at less than 60% of the time.   The most common problem when people have links like "more" or "click here" which do not describe where the link will take the user.

      Data tables are a huge problem shown by the low compliance of the next two rules related to a providing an accessible name and headers to provide context to the content of the data cells.

      the rule for labeling form controls has steadily improved over the past 10 years to almost 90% compliance in this evaluation.  Ten years ago when I started these evaluations less that 50% of form controls had labels.  But this is such an important and easy requirement to implement it hard to understand why compliance is not higher.

      The use of grouping label for radio buttons using fieldset and legend elements is still an area of poor implementation, with just over 50% compliance.  The is definitely a need for form designers to learn more about creating accessible forms with accessible error feedback.

      The Skip to main link provides a means for keyboard only users to move directly to the main content of the page and is implemented in about 70% of the pages evaluated and is considered a basic accessibility feature.

      The last four rules in the chart related to videos having captions, audio must have an alternative, the ability of users to have time to respond to web pages with time outs and website navigation features all require manual checks.

      These features need to be addressed during the design of the website, because just like curbcuts in sidewalks they are expensive to retrofit into production websites.
