        The chart in this slide shows the distribution of disabilities that are registered with disability services at Illinois during the 2019-2020 academic year.

        If you cannot see the chart or have difficulty reading charts there is an option to view a table of the data after the chart on the web page.

        I am pointing to the number of students in each category in the chart using the mouse:

        The chart shows:
        838 students with psychological diagnosis which effect learning in some way, example accommodations include taking tests in a safe environment or flexible schedules due to medication schedules or episodic situations.

        641 students with ADHD that may need coaching for prioritizing their work or distraction free testing accommodations.

        362 students with systemic or medical conditions that effect their daily living, for example a chronic disease like arthritis which may restrict mobility and reduced stamina.

        167 students with physical mobility impairments due to amputations or paralysis.

        161 students with learning disabilities that require the student to use different strategies to learn some types of materials, often requiring materials in electronic format for reading using speech.

        49 students who are Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing, these students rely on interpreters and text captioning for learning.

        47 students who are Blind or visually impaired who need print material in electronic formats or Braille with descriptions of images and graphics.

        16 students with acquired brain injury, including soldiers returning from overseas deployments, which often results in both learning disabilities and physiological issues which is helped by having multi-modal and flexible learning environments.

        2 students with impaired speech making it difficult for them to communicate to their instructors or fellow students.  In these cases disability staff can help develop communication strategies help the student to express their ideas in instructional settings and be a part of social groups with peers.

        While the traditional stereotype of disability is someone with vision, hearing or physical impairment, from the chart you can see that the vast majority of students registered have learning disabilities or psychological conditions that effect their learning.

        The largest groups are often referred to as hidden disabilities, and so it is often difficult for people to understand their needs for materials in certain formats to support learning.

        It should be noted that typically only about a third of students with disabilities in higher education actually register for disability related accommodations.

        In a survey of all students at Illinois a few years ago, students who self identify as having a disability, only a third said they used disability services.

        Another third reported they did not need accommodations or could negotiate them on their own.

        The remaining third said they did not even know there were disability services available on campus.

        So you can see there are a lot of students in higher education and many students who can benefit from universal design in learning.
